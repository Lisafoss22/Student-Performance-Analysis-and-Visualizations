# Student-Performance-Analysis-and-Visualizations


Student Performance Analysis and Visualization
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of student performance data, focusing on key metrics and trends across various subjects. Utilizing Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I applied statistical techniques and visualizations to derive insights regarding student academic performance.

Key Achievements:
Data Exploration: Loaded and explored a dataset containing student scores in Math, Reading, and Writing, identifying patterns and correlations between different subjects.
Predictive Analytics: Calculated probabilities of students scoring above 50 in each subject, revealing insights about overall student performance.
Visualization: Created engaging visualizations to illustrate the relationships between scores, including continuous and categorical features against target scores.
Statistical Inference: Conducted tests to check data distribution and skewness, facilitating a deeper understanding of the scores' characteristics.
Performance Metrics: Analyzed overall student success, determining the percentage of students passing in all subjects, revealing critical insights for educational strategies.
This project not only enhanced my data analysis and visualization skills but also provided valuable insights into academic performance, contributing to potential improvements in educational practices.
